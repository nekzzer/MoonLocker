## 🧠 What is MoonLocker?

**MoonLocker** is an over-the-top Windows locker written in **Python**, designed to demonstrate:

- Fullscreen Tkinter UI manipulation
- Aggressive visual & audio effects
- Keyboard input interception
- Registry-based auto-start behavior
- Chaos-based animations and panic escalation mechanics

It intentionally creates an **uncomfortable, noisy, chaotic experience** until the correct password is entered.

This project is **NOT malware for real-world use** — it is a **proof-of-concept / meme project**.
